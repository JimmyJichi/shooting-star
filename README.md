## Game Mechanics

1. **Daily Schedule**: Each day, 6 shooting star events are scheduled at random times throughout the day (24-hour period)

2. **Channel Assignment**: Each event is predetermined to appear in a specific channel, ensuring each channel gets events throughout the day

3. **Catch Messages**: When a shooting star appears, users must type one of these exact messages:
   - rawr
   - scylla
   - object
   - slime
   - ithaca
   - tiddles

4. **Time Limit**: Users have 60 seconds to type the correct message to catch the shooting star

5. **Rewards**: The first person to type the correct message earns 130 coins

6. If no one catches it within 60 seconds, the shooting star fades away
